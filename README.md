<h1 align="center">Open in X seconds</h1>

Open in X seconds (oixs) is a web extension for Firefox and Chromium based browsers that allows you to open links with a variable delay of your choosing. Minimal and customizable, with very intuitive interface, it aims to improve modern browsing experience for users with less stable connection or older hardware.
